### The diffusion equation


In this lab we consider the diffusion equation

where D is a positive constant.

In the lecture we disusses to the implicit algorithm

which may be written as a system of linear equations

where the coefficient matrix M is given by

In the given source code implement the function **step()** that solves this system of linear equations in each time step.

Note that the matrix is tri-diagonal and that it is sufficient to store the entries of the modified main diagonal and the right-hand side during forward substitution.
